            <h1 class="ui header">Terms of Use</h1>
            <h2 class="ui medium header">Definitions:</h2>
            <p>Fokus mobile application, hereinafter referred to as “app” and “application” Creators of Fokus application: Stanisław Góra, Mikołaj Mirko, Mateusz Janicki, hereinafter referred to as “we” and “us”, User of the Fokus application, hereinafter referred to as “you”,
            </p>
            <p>By downloading or using this app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should therefore make sure that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app in any way or create/distribute derivative versions. You’re not allowed to extract the source code of the app or any files/data included in the application package file. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to us.
            </p>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>The Fokus app stores and processes personal data that you give us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features. As a result the app could stop working properly.
            </p>
            <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app are bound to owners:
            </p>
            <p>Firebase, Google Play Services, Google Analytics, Google Crashlytics, One Signal. 
            </p>
            <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. By using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
            </p>
            <p>We also cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery while you are using the app some information might be lost.
            </p>
            <p>With respect to our responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we strive to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. We do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
            </p>
            <h2 class="ui medium header">Changes to This Terms and Conditions:</h2>
            <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
